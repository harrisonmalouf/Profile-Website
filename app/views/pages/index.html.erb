      <div class="row">
        <p class="Para-Padding">
          I’m Harrison, I'd classify myself as an adventurous soul! I’ve done alot of travelling around the world and can’t wait to see more. Some of my all-time favourite would be Japan, Egypt and America. </p>

        <p class="Para-Padding">
         I’ve worked at some interesting jobs like boat maintenance, as a driver for different companies and worked in the legal industry. A key word to describe me would be grit, I don’t give up when going gets tough.

         Coming fresh out my course at General Assembly I can’t wait to start my journey as a junior software engineer!

              During our time in general assembly our class was asked to present a group project within a week. Me and AJ Tauber, rose to this challenge to complete a project we are both passionate about with the framework Ruby on Rails.

              Through thick and thin we crusaded through this together and created something that we didn’t think we were capable of. As an individual I felt our co-ordination, strict time management and respect for one another was what made this project so successful.

              This was by far my most ambitious project. During the time in this course one of my weakest programming languages was JavaScript, I felt a trial by fire might be the best way to wrap my head around a language I was struggling with, and it did. It’s important to note that I used p5 as a library to help create this game.

              For my very first project using vanilla JavaScript I made a Tic Tac Toe game. This was by far one of the steepest learning curves during the course due to how close it was to the beginning of my education.

             This was a part in time where I had enough time to focus on some fun and exciting CSS effects that have inspired me to think critically about how to approach making a website interactive.
